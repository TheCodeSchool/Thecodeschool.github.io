I decied to convert my site over to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) and [host it with Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/). This allows all my content to live in static files and be built automatically by [GitHub](https://github.com). My hope is that with this simplification (and automation) I might actually post a little more this year.  

Even if this doesn't motivate me to post more at least a new year started with a new project !
